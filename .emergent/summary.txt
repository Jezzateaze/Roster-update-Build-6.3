The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a systematic approach to developing and refining a Shift Roster and Pay Calculation application. Key phases included initial setup, addressing UI inconsistencies (calendar/shift placement), implementing bulk editing, and crucially, building a robust authentication system. The engineer diligently addressed user-reported bugs, such as staff profile saving, unassigned shift assignments, incorrect pay summaries, and advanced shift editing (2:1, overlap control). A major focus was on an iterative bug-fixing process for pay calculations, specifically for shifts ending at 8:00 PM, involving backend logic adjustments, extensive testing, and troubleshooting deployment inconsistencies. Alongside bug fixes, the engineer added significant features like a dedicated Manage Templates interface and comprehensive hour/pay tracking (daily, weekly, YTD totals for staff and admin).

<product_requirements>
The application is a mobile-friendly workforce management system for shift rostering and pay calculation in Queensland, Australia, adhering to the SCHADS Award. Core features include a Monday-start calendar, accurate pay calculation (day/evening/night, weekend, public holiday rates, sleepover allowance) only for assigned active staff, and configurable pay rates. It must support flexible shift customization, manual overrides, bulk actions, and full editing for all shift attributes (time, date, staff, 2:1, overlap). Break violation alerts are required. Various calendar views (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Grid) are needed. Template and event management (save/load roster/day templates) and Google Calendar-like events are essential. UI/UX emphasizes mobile responsiveness, no calendar cell scrolling, and quick settings (first day of week, time format, dark mode). Authentication is PIN-based with Role-Based Access (Admin, Supervisor, Staff), providing individual staff dashboards, availability, and a shift request system. Admin users require comprehensive staff profile management (personal/professional details, photo upload, privileges). Staff should see a profile button with settings, account info, and an optional after-tax income with superannuation contributions, with YTD calculations (calendar year for admin, financial year for staff, with toggle option). The user specifically requested a Manage Roster Templates button for viewing, editing, modifying, deleting, and saving templates, displaying shift hours, daily, weekly, and YTD totals (hours and gross pay) for all staff, and an optional after-tax calculation for staff based on Australian tax standards. A critical pay calculation bug for 12:00PM-8:00PM shifts (Day rate vs. Evening rate) was also reported and addressed.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture, compartmentalized into  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core FastAPI application handling all business logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Refined  and  functions to correctly classify shifts and apply SCHADS Award-compliant rates.
        -   Specifically, the  function's logic for  shifts was adjusted to  (shifts ending *after* 8:00 PM are evening) to fix the 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM pay calculation bug, ensuring 8:00 PM is considered 'Day'.
        -   Comprehensive CRUD operations for roster entries, staff, settings, roster/day templates, and calendar events are implemented.
        -    was updated for  and 2:1 shifts.
        -   A robust authentication system with  enum,  model, JWTs, and endpoints (, , , , , ) is in place.
        -   The PUT endpoint for roster entries was fixed to respect the  flag.
        -   New endpoints will be required for YTD calculations and template management.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component, responsible for UI rendering, application state, and API communication.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Refactored for modularity with distinct tabs (calendar, staff, settings) using Shadcn UI.
        -   Fixed date alignment, applied timezone-safe formatting, and corrected day-of-week calculations.
        -   Enhanced  and integrated quick settings.
        -   Implemented a comprehensive bulk editing system for shift templates.
        -   **Authentication System**: Integrated ,  states,  and  functions, and associated UI components (, , ). The application flow is wrapped in an authentication check.
        -   **Profile Management**: Added  and  for user and staff profile updates (personal and professional details, photo upload placeholder). Save functionality for these dialogs is implemented.
        -   **Shift Editing Enhancement**: Added Mon Aug 18 08:56:43 UTC 2025, , and  fields to the shift editing dialog, ensuring correct data submission to the backend.
        -   **Pay Calculation Fix**: The  logic was verified to align with the corrected backend logic (treating shifts ending *at* 8:00 PM as 'Day').
        -   **New Features**:
            -   A Manage Templates button and corresponding  have been added to the roster section, allowing users to view and manage saved templates.
            -   Functions for displaying individual shift hours, daily totals, and weekly totals have been added to the calendar view.
            -   A YTD Report button and  have been added to display comprehensive Year-To-Date shift hours and gross pay for all staff, and potentially after-tax income.
        -   Other fixes: badge logic for  calculation, pay summary only for assigned active staff, daily navigation buttons.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed several user requirements and critical bug fixes.

The product's current state includes:
1.  **Pay Calculation Bug Fix (12:00PM-8:00PM shifts)**: The critical bug where 12:00PM-8:00PM shifts were incorrectly calculated at evening rates (56) instead of day rates (36) has been fully resolved. The  function in  now correctly classifies shifts ending *at* 8:00 PM as 'Day' shifts by using  for evening shift detection. This fix has been verified and is working correctly in the backend, with corresponding frontend badge logic consistent.
2.  **Roster Templates Management Interface**: A dedicated Manage Templates button and dialog () have been implemented in the frontend (). This interface allows users to view all saved roster templates, although the functionality for editing, modifying, deleting, and seeing included shifts within this dialog is not explicitly detailed as completed, the structure for management is in place.
3.  **Enhanced Hour Tracking and Reporting**:
    *   Individual shift hours are now displayed on the roster.
    *   Daily totals for rostered hours are calculated and shown.
    *   Weekly totals for rostered hours are displayed.
    *   A YTD Report button and  have been added. This dialog is intended to provide year-to-date total shift hours and gross pay for all staff, and potentially allows for after-tax income calculation and superannuation contributions with configurable tax brackets, toggling between calendar and financial years. The UI components are in place, but the full backend logic for comprehensive YTD data aggregation (especially considering calendar vs. financial year, tax, and superannuation) is likely still pending.

All authentication and user profile management (including admin and staff profile saving, unassigned shift assignment, and enhanced shift editing with 2:1 and allow overlap toggles) were previously completed and verified. The application is in a stable state with these features and fixes implemented, ready for further development on the remaining pending tasks.

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to fully implement the backend logic for comprehensive YTD calculations, including tax and superannuation, and ensure its persistence.
