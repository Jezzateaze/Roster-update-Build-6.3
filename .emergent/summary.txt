<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and expanded a workforce management system. A recurring  library issue on the backend caused frequent service disruptions, which was consistently diagnosed and resolved. Key features implemented include a revamped login system with user selection and PIN management (including fixes for dialog responsiveness and moving PIN change to settings), role-based date filtering for available shifts, and organized staff availability. Most recently, a comprehensive export functionality for roster and pay data (PDF, Excel, CSV) was added, supporting various date ranges and role-based data access. The engineer demonstrated proficiency in debugging persistent environment issues and implementing complex frontend and backend logic.

<product_requirements>
The application is a mobile-friendly workforce management system for shift rostering and pay calculation under the Australian SCHADS Award, featuring configurable rates and PIN-based Role-Based Access (Admin, Supervisor, Staff). Recent requirements focused on:
1.  **NDIS Charge Rate Integration**: Display NDIS charges on the roster for Admin, replacing staff pay rates.
2.  **Shift & Staff Availability**: Tabbed view for Available Unassigned Shifts (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Calendar, Search Date), with staff only seeing current/future shifts, and Admin/Supervisor having a toggle for past shifts. Staff Availability section to be organized by Availability Type, then by date and time.
3.  **Client Profile System**: OCR for NDIS plan data extraction, batch processing, and an editable Client BIO section.
4.  **Export Functionality**: Roster and pay data export to PDF, Excel, and CSV, with role-based access and selection by weekly, monthly, or custom date range.
5.  **Enhanced Login System**: User dropdown, iPhone-style PIN keypad, first-time PIN change prompt (4 or 6 digits), admin PIN reset, with the forced PIN change after first login removed, and staff allowed to change PIN in settings.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application for business logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: Defined Pydantic models (Client, NDISPlanDetails, etc.). Implemented CRUD for clients. Added OCR integration (,  endpoints). Enhanced Client Profile with biography fields and corresponding  endpoint. Implemented PIN management endpoints (, ). Added role-based access filtering for client and roster data. **Added comprehensive export endpoints:**  and **new range-based endpoints**  for CSV, Excel, PDF, integrating , , . Added  for pre-authentication user fetching.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added , ,  for export functionality.  was a recurring system-level dependency issue, requiring re-installation.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API communication.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Client Profile**: Integrated , , , displaying NDIS plan and bio fields.
        -   **OCR**: Integrated frontend functions for OCR document processing and polling.
        -   **Shift Times**: Fixed logic to correctly classify weekend shifts for accurate rate display.
        -   **Login System**: Removed auto-login. Introduced new state variables (, , , , , , , , ). Implemented multi-step login UI with iPhone-style keypad.  calls .  manages login/PIN flows. **Fixed dropdown not rendering users due to  backend issues.** **Fixed unresponsive PIN change dialog by correctly setting  and adding 'Cancel' buttons**. **Removed forced first-time PIN change and moved voluntary PIN change functionality to a new Security Settings section within the main **.
        -   **Shift & Staff Availability**: Added  state for Admin/Supervisor toggle. Modified  to filter past shifts based on user role and toggle. Added UI toggle for Admin/Supervisor. **Introduced  helper function and updated the Staff Availability UI to group by type and sort by date/time**.
        -   **Export Functionality**: Implemented , ,  states. Created  to handle weekly, monthly, and custom date range exports. Updated the Export UI to include date range selection (Current Week, Current Month, Custom Range) and professional export format buttons (PDF, Excel, CSV), with dynamic date calculations and smart validation.

-   **/app/frontend/.env & /app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables (, ).
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct value modifications.

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop individual staff dashboards and availability management (initial framework exists).
-   Create a shift request system (initial framework exists).
-   Implement an admin panel for full user management.
-   Further refine UI/UX based on future feedback.
-   Staff should have the ability to see the entire roster (assigned and unassigned shifts), only showing their own pay and all unassigned pay.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully implemented and thoroughly tested the **enhanced export functionality**. This feature allows both Admin and Staff users to export roster and pay data in PDF, Excel, and CSV formats. Users can select data by Current Week, Current Month, or a Custom Range using date pickers. The backend was updated with new endpoints to support these date ranges and maintains role-based access, ensuring staff users can only export their own shift data. Frontend UI was updated with a clear, professional interface for range and format selection, including dynamic date calculations and validation.

This comprehensive export system was confirmed to be working flawlessly, with all backend endpoints (for both monthly and range-based exports) returning correct data and file types, and authentication/role-based filtering functioning as expected. The frontend successfully initiates downloads for the generated files.

The last message from the user (Chat Message 402) indicates a new request for the next development cycle: modifying the roster view for staff users.
