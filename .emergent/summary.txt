The previous AI engineer meticulously developed a full-stack Shift Roster and Pay Calculation application, starting from an MVP and iteratively enhancing it based on user feedback. Initial development focused on core rostering, complex pay calculations adhering to the SCHADS Award, staff management, and shift assignments, alongside resolving subtle bugs. Subsequently, the engineer improved user experience, adding comprehensive roster/day template management, multiple calendar views (daily, weekly, monthly), and event management. UI/UX was significantly refined for mobile responsiveness and readability.

Key technical challenges addressed included a persistent monthly calendar date misalignment, which was debugged and fixed by standardizing date handling and ensuring full month display, often requiring  intervention. Following this, shift placement inaccuracies were resolved by fixing  usage, enforcing consistent Monday-first day-of-week logic, and enhancing staff assignment with alphabetical sorting and chronological shift ordering. A major feature addition was the comprehensive bulk editing system for shift templates, incorporating individual deletion, bulk selection, editing, and cloning.

The engineer also implemented dynamic quick-access UI toggles for the first day of the week, time format (12hr/24hr), and dark mode. Most recently, the engineer initiated a large-scale authentication and user management system. The immediate focus before this summary request was on fixing critical bugs (pay summary display, daily navigation) and beginning the backend and frontend implementation of the new authentication system with detailed PIN management and role-based access control, as confirmed by the user, setting the stage for significant architectural changes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on a significant expansion of the application to include a comprehensive **user authentication and management system** with role-based access control, as per the user's explicit request.

This work was initiated by the user reporting several immediate issues:
1.  **Pay summary not working** for individual staff.
2.  **Badge logic fix**: Weekday shifts ending by 8:00 PM should display Day badge.
3.  **Daily view navigation buttons not working**.

The engineer prioritized these immediate bug fixes, starting with:
-   **Daily View Navigation**: Identified and fixed issues related to  vs  state mismatches and incorrect function calls in  to ensure proper navigation.
-   **Pay Summary**: Examined existing code (, ) and confirmed  component import, but the fix itself was not explicitly stated as completed; rather, it was next in the immediate fixes queue.

Following these immediate fixes, the engineer proceeded with the initial steps of the authentication system:
-   **Backend ()**:
    -   Defined  enum (, , ).
    -   Created a  model with fields like , , and .
    -   Implemented authentication helper functions (, , , , ).
    -   Added core authentication API endpoints (,  for login, , , , , and endpoints for user management like ).
-   **Frontend ()**:
    -   Introduced authentication state variables (, ).
    -   Added authentication functions (, ).
    -   Integrated authentication UI components (LoginDialog, ChangePinDialog, RegisterDialog).

The engineer's last explicit action in the trajectory was adding these authentication UI components to the frontend, indicating the core framework for login and user management is now in place. The next immediate steps are to address the remaining bug fixes (pay summary, badge logic, daily navigation) and then build out the comprehensive profile and shift editing features on top of the newly established authentication foundation.
