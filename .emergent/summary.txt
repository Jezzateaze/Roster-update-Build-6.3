<analysis>
The previous AI engineer meticulously developed a full-stack Shift Roster and Pay Calculation application, evolving it from an MVP through iterative enhancements driven by user feedback. Initially, the focus was on core rostering, complex pay calculations adhering to SCHADS Award, staff management, and shift assignments, resolving subtle bugs in logic and display. The engineer then addressed user experience, attempting simplified local deployment and later pivoting to substantial feature additions. Key developments included comprehensive roster and day template management (save/load), implementation of multiple calendar views (daily, weekly, monthly), and integration of Google Calendar-like event management. Significant UI/UX improvements were made for mobile responsiveness, button layouts, and calendar readability. Most recently, the engineer added robust bulk shift selection/management and a nuanced 2:1 shift overlap allowance. The process involved constant debugging, backend/frontend synchronization, and immediate visual verification via screenshots. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively fixing a critical date alignment bug in the monthly calendar view.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a professional, mobile-friendly workforce management application for shift rostering and pay calculation, specifically tailored for Queensland. The application should support:
-   **Core Rostering and Pay Calculation**: Displaying shifts on a Monday-start calendar, with accurate pay calculation based on SCHADS Award rules (Weekday Day/Evening/Night, Saturday, Sunday, Public Holiday rates, 75 sleepover allowance with wake time).
-   **Public Holiday Integration**: Utilizing an external API for Queensland public holidays.
-   **Management Features**: Staff management (listing 12 staff, active status, adding staff), shift assignment with real-time pay, and configurable pay rates via settings (Default/SCHADS Award modes).
-   **Shift Customization**: Adjusting default shift templates and individual shift times, including manual overrides for pay rates and shift types.
-   **Break Warning System**: Notifying users of less than 10-hour breaks between shifts, with sleepover exceptions.
-   **Shift Operations**: Adding, removing (individual), clearing (monthly), and managing shifts.
-   **Calendar Views**: Displaying shifts from previous/next months and offering Daily, Weekly, and Monthly calendar views.
-   **Template Management**: Saving/loading entire roster templates and individual day templates (favorites) based on day-of-week, not specific dates.
-   **Event Management**: Adding Google Calendar-like appointments, meetings, tasks, reminders with priorities, completion tracking, and location/description.
-   **Bulk Actions**: Selecting and performing actions (delete, edit) on multiple shifts simultaneously.
-   **Overlap Management**: Allowing specific shifts (identified by 2:1 in name) to overlap for multiple staff, with a manual override option in the Add Shift dialog.
-   **UI Enhancements**: Ensuring all content is visible without excessive scrolling in calendar cells, and organizing action buttons for better display on mobile.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with distinct  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI application, handling all business logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Extensive modifications to  for SCHADS Award rules, including evening/weekend/public holiday rates and sleepover allowances.
        -   Added  for 10-hour break rule with sleepover exceptions.
        -   Implemented  for badge classification.
        -   Introduced CRUD endpoints for roster entries, staff, settings, and new functionality: , , and .
        -   Enhanced  logic to include exceptions for 2:1 shifts and a manual  flag.
        -   Updated shift creation/update endpoints to pass  and  for overlap checks.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component managing UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Refactored for main calendar, staff, and settings tabs.
        -   Integrated Shadcn UI components for various dialogs (shift assignment, template editing, add shift, break warning).
        -   Implemented , , , ,  functions.
        -   Added logic for  management (save/load) and  management (save/load with S/L buttons on days).
        -   Implemented  (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and dynamic rendering for each view.
        -   Integrated  management (add/edit events, tasks, reminders) with dedicated dialogs and display logic.
        -   Added : ,  state, toolbar with , , ,  buttons.
        -   Implemented  for daily view.
        -   Updated  dialog to include Allow Overlap toggle with warning.
        -   Introduced  for easier setup in  tab.
        -   Modified  and related date logic to fix date misalignment issues.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Applied styling for professional layout, consistent spacing, color schemes, badges, and dialogs. Significantly updated to improve calendar cell height (), ensure all shifts are visible without scrolling, and adjust button layout (two rows) for better mobile responsiveness. Added styles for improved scrolling and checkbox visibility.

-   **/app/frontend/.env & /app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Importance**: Store environment variables (, ).
    -   **Changes Made**: Values were read but never modified as per system instructions.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the actual functionality for exporting rosters/data into PDF, Excel, and CSV formats, beyond the existing export capabilities framework. (This was an initial pending task).
-   Investigate and propose the simplest possible local deployment solution for the user. (This was an initial pending task, but was addressed by proposing existing live link and Vercel/Railway options, then the user changed context).
-   Complete the fix for the monthly view shift date misalignment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively debugging and fixing a critical date misalignment bug in the monthly calendar view. The user reported that shifts added were displaying under the wrong calendar day in the monthly view, despite having the correct underlying date when clicked. For example, a shift added to Monday 25th August 2025 was appearing under Tuesday 19th August 2025 in the monthly calendar.

The engineer identified the problem as likely related to date calculation, timezone issues, or inconsistent date object handling within the  and  functions in .

The engineer's last action (Chat Message 308) was to modify the  function, specifically updating how date objects are generated and used within the calendar grid to ensure consistent date matching.
Specifically, the engineer updated the  function to iterate through dates more reliably:

The engineer is currently at the stage of testing this fix to see if the date alignment issue is resolved, as indicated by the final tool call to take a screenshot (Chat Message 309). The state of the application is that all previously implemented features (pay calculation, roster/day templates, multiple views, event management, bulk selection, 2:1 overlap allowance, UI enhancements) are considered functional based on prior tests and screenshots, with this date display bug being the immediate problem.
